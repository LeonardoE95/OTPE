# OTPE â€“ On The Power of Emacs

This repository will contain various examples whos sole purpose is to show the versatility of Emacs, a pretty old joked about OS.

## Snippets of Emacs-Lisp

The versatility of Emacs comes mainly from the macro system and the ability to execute emacs-lisp code within it. Here I will list a bunch of use cases I've found over my time using Emacs that I use daily to automate boring tasks.

## My configurations

I'm always changing my config, so here I will just list those configurations that can be understood without choosing drugs or alcohol as coping mechanisms.
From time to time I also showcase these configurations on my youtube channel, but I do that mainly in italian.
